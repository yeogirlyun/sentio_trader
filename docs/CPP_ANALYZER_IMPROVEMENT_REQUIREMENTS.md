# C++ Code Analyzer Enhancement Requirements

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 22, 2025  
**Project**: Sentio Trading System  
**Author**: Development Team  

## Executive Summary

Based on our experience using the C++ code analyzer on the Sentio trading system (45 files, 350+ functions), we identified significant limitations in the current regex-based approach. This document outlines requirements for a next-generation analyzer that provides actionable insights for codebase cleanup and maintenance.

## Current Analyzer Limitations Identified

### 1. **False Positive Detection Issues**
- **Control Structure Misidentification**: Detected `if`, `for`, `while` statements as "unused functions"
- **Keyword Confusion**: Flagged language keywords as function names
- **Pattern Matching Failures**: Regex-based parsing missed complex C++ syntax

### 2. **Limited Semantic Understanding**
- **No Call Graph Analysis**: Couldn't trace function calls through inheritance, templates, or function pointers
- **Missing Context Awareness**: Failed to understand virtual functions, operator overloads, and template specializations
- **Shallow Duplicate Detection**: Only found exact text matches, missed semantic duplicates

### 3. **Inadequate Actionability**
- **No Priority Ranking**: All issues treated equally without impact assessment
- **Missing Refactoring Suggestions**: Identified problems but provided no solutions
- **Limited Integration**: No IDE integration or automated fix capabilities
